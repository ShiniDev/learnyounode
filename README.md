<h2>My Thoughts</h2>
<p>
    Well, installing the workshop through npm and verifying exercises in a 
    node environment is very good. Actually, I was supposed to learn javascript first
    but I figured out that I should just shoot straight to serverside javascript.
    Overall the workshop is good, I have learned a lot.
